Identation
----------
Python uses the colon symbol (:) and indentation for showing where blocks of code begin and end (If you come
from another language, do not confuse this with somehow being related to the ternary operator). That is, blocks in
Python, such as functions, loops, if clauses and other constructs, have no ending identifiers. All blocks start with a
colon and then contain the indented lines below it.


Datatypes
---------
Data types are nothing but variables you use to reserve some space in memory.
String are identified as a contiguous set of characters represented in the quotation marks.
